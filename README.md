# About

Creates a GitHub repository with _release_ environment and protected branches that can access secrets in this environment.
This is an ideal setup for most repositories that follow PR-based development with automated releases from protected branches.
Works best with GitHub action [agilecustoms/release](https://github.com/agilecustoms/release)

![Cover](docs/images/cover.png)

## Highlights

Create a GitHub repository with security best practices:
- default branch (`main` by default)
- `release` environment - hold secrets used in release workflow (when you create version and publish it)
- release branches â€” branches that have access to `release` environment (`main` by default)
- developers cannot create/modify/delete tags (to protect release tags)
- admins must approve any changes in `.github` (to protect leaks of secrets in workflows)

## Usage

```hcl
module "repo_my_app" {
  source = "agilecustoms/repo/github"

  name             = "my-app"
  description      = "Repo description"
  visibility       = "private" # default
  release_branches = ["main", "next", "legacy"] # default is ["main"]
  reviewers_github = ["<gh-org-name>/ci-admins"] # here ci-admins is an example, can be any team(s) or user(s)
  release_environment_secrets = {
    # any secrets to access artifact store, plus GH PAT to make automated commit/tag during release workflow
    GH_TOKEN = var.gh_token
  }

  # if your repo is a GitHub Action and needs to be accessible from other corporate repos
  actions_repository_access_level = "organization"
}
```

To start managing an existing repo, import it first:
```shell
terraform import 'module.repo_my_app.github_repository.repo' my-app
# if there is already a CODEOWNERS file in the repo, import it too:
terraform import 'module.repo_my_app.github_repository_file.codeowners[0]' my-app/.github/CODEOWNERS
```
